## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This project is based on real spending data for three months. Using this data we applied three techniques such as Cluster, Association, and neural network analysis. We were trying to solve following questions.

* What are the categories and stores that we frequently purchase our daily stuffs?
* How is our buying pattern and What are the items that we most likely buy together?
* How can we optimize our spending on grocery?

## üéà Data Understanding and Exploring <a name="data_understanding_and_exploring"></a>

**This is a metadata of the data set**.

**The above histogram represents the amount spent on different merchandise category across various stores.** 

## ‚õèÔ∏è Data Preparation <a name = "data-preparation"></a>

### Clustering

I used K-means clustering to classify the data based on category, store name, items, and amount.

## üöÄ Data Modeling <a name = "data-modeling"></a>

### Association Analysis

![alt text](https://github.com/cghimire/Grocery-Management-System/blob/master/Grocery%20img/grocery_frequentItems.png "Most frequent Items")

**Above histogram shows the most frequent items in the data set**.

### Recommendation Rule

![alt text](https://github.com/cghimire/Grocery-Management-System/blob/master/Grocery%20img/recom%20rule.png "recommendation rule")     

**We created Association Rules: min support as 0.01, confidence as 0.05 and sorted with ‚Äòhigh-confidence‚Äô rule. The rules with confidence of 1  imply that, whenever the LHS item was purchased, the RHS item was also purchased 100% of the time**.

### Neural Network Model

**After splitting data set into training and testing set, I added column to each training and test data to see if the model is fit**.

**Above matrix shows that out of 59 Needs 55 were predicted correctly, and out of 21 want 20 were predicted correctly**.

## Model Evaluation and Conclusion <a name = "model-evaluation-and-conclusion"></a>

The neural net model is used to predict our spending and optimize our budget loading data for April month.

**As we can see when we purchase Red onions from Columbia Store it is classified as our Needs, meaning the Red onion is something we can‚Äôt avoid buying**.
